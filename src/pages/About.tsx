        ACM@UIUC is the <a style={{ textDecoration: 'none', color: '#4577F8' }} href="https://www.acm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Association for Computing Machinery</a> student 
        chapter, the world's largest scientific computer society. We are a group of 
        dedicated people interested in exploring the possibilities of computers 
        and discovering new ways to use them!

        ACM contains Special Interest Groups, or SIGs, which focus on specific 
        applications of computer science. In our chapter, each SIG operates under 
        ACM@UIUC with free range over its meetings, activities, and purpose. Some 
        SIGs are project-based and devote time to building something innovative or 
        spectacular to showcase. Others are dedicated to teaching, using talks and 
        workshops to help their members understand a particular topic. You can learn 
        more about each SIG on our <NavLink style={{ textDecoration: 'none', color: '#4577F8' }} to="/" className="navLink">home page</NavLink>!

        ACM@UIUC also runs various events throughout the year, such as ACM Open House, 
        which showcases all the different SIGs at the beginning of each semester, <a style={{ textDecoration: 'none', color: '#4577F8' }} href="https://www.reflectionsprojections.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Reflections | Projections</a>, 
        our annual computing conference, and <a style={{ textDecoration: 'none', color: '#4577F8' }} href="https://hackillinois.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HackIllinois</a>, 
        which is one of the largest hackathons in the nation. We also host a variety of 
        outreach and social events, such as picnics, activity weeks, ACM Happy Hour, 
        and our annual bar crawl. Our SIGs also run their own events! These events are 
        open to all of UIUC, regardless of technical experience or background!

        Our executive meetings occur every other week and are open to the public. 
        The ACM officer board, as well as SIG and committee leads, drive discussion 
        about important ACM matters and make decisions based on the consensus of meeting attendees.
